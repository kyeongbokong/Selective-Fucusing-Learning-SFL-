## About Selective Focusing Learing

Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have demonstrated remarkable success due to their class-wise controllability and superior quality for complex generation tasks. Typical cGANs solve the joint distribution matching problem by decomposing two easier sub-problems: marginal matching and conditional matching. From our toy experiments, we found that it is the best to apply only conditional matching to certain samples due to the content-aware optimization of the discriminator. This paper proposes a simple (a few lines of code) but effective training methodology, selective focusing learning, which enforces the discriminator and generator to learn easy samples of each class rapidly while maintaining diversity. Our key idea is to selectively apply conditional and joint matching for the data in each mini-batch. We conducted experiments on recent cGAN variants in ImageNet (64x64 and 128x128), CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, and improved the performance significantly (up to 35.18% in terms of FID) without sacrificing diversity.

## Training BigGAN on ImageNet with Selective Focusing Learing

To train BigGAN models we use the [BigGAN-PyTorch](https://github.com/ajbrock/BigGAN-PyTorch) repo. We perform minimal changes to the code, consisting only of adding options for instance selection and additional metric logging. A list of changes made to the original repo can be found in the change log at [BigGAN-PyTorch/change_log.md](https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/instance_selection_for_gans/blob/master/BigGAN-PyTorch/change_log.md). 

#### Preparing Data
To train a BigGAN on ImageNet you will first need to construct an HDF5 dataset file for ImageNet (optional), compute Inception moments for calculating FID, and construct the image manifold for calculating Precision, Recall, Density, and Coverage. All can by done by modifying and running 
```
bash scripts/utils/prepare_data_imagenet_[res].sh
```
where [res] is substituted with the desired resolution (options are 64, 128, or 256). These scripts will assume that ImageNet is in a folder called `data` in the instance_selection_for_gans directory. Replace this with the filepath to your copy of ImageNet. 

#### 64x64 ImageNet
To replicate our best 64x64 model run `bash scripts/launch_SAGAN_res64_ch32_bs128_dstep_1_rr40.sh`. A single GPU with at least 12GB of memory should be sufficient to train this model. Training is expected to take about 2-3 days on a high-end GPU.

#### 128x128 ImageNet
To replicate 128x128 ImageNet results run `bash scripts/launch_BigGAN_res128_ch64_bs256_dstep_1_rr50.sh`. This script assumes that training will be done on 8 GPUs with 16GB of memory each. To train with less GPUs, or if you encounter out-of-memory errors, you can try reducing `batch_size` and increasing `num_G_accumulations` and `num_D_accumulations` to achieve the desired effective batch size (effective batch size = batch_size x num_accumulations).
To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

## Applying Selective Focusing Learing to Your Own Dataset or Any Class-cGAN Network

Selective Focusing Learing can be applied to any class labelled PyTorch dataset using the `SFL` function. When classes are provided, Selective Focusing Learing will be applied separately for each class.  

The main hyperparameter for Selective Focusing Learing is the `retention_ratio`, a value from 0 to 100 which indicates the percentage of distribution matching that should be selected from the conditional matching. 

```python
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from SFL import SFL

# images are expected to be in range [-1, 1]
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),
                                transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
                                                     std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5])])

# replace CIFAR10 with your own dataset 
dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='.', transform=transform, download=True)
instance_selected_dataset = select_instances(dataset, retention_ratio=50)
